/**
<!-- globalinfo-start -->
 * Class for a filtered instance stream.<p>
 * The filter can be used in either of two modes<br>
 * - directly as an instance stream, in which case it extracts the instances from the source stream and converts them to serve up to the consumer, or<br>
 * - the convert() method can directly translate an instance from the base stream into an instance for the output stream.<p>
 * The default methods pass all calls through to the source stream.<p>
 * The ClassSafeInstanceStreamFilter subclass is for stream filters that do not change the number of classes<p>
